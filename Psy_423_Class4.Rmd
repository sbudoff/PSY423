## Variablity

How spread out our data is

```{r plot1}
# Number of data points
n <- 1000

# Generate data for unimodal distribution
tight_data <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.5)

# Generate data for bimodal distribution
spread_data <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Generate data for trimodal distribution
very_data <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 2)

# Create data frame for plotting
df_var <- data.frame(
  Distribution = rep(c("SD = 0.5", "SD = 1.0", "SD = 2.0"), each = n),
  Values = c(tight_data, spread_data, very_data)
)

# Create a set of density plots using facet_wrap
ggplot(df_var, aes(x = Values, fill = Distribution)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Values", y = "Density", title = "Distributions With Different Variance") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "green", "purple")) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Distribution"))
```

## Measures of Variability

1) Range = Maximum - Minimum

2) Standard Deviation = How far apart numbers are (their difference from the mean) in a dataset

3) Variance = The average difference each value has from the mean **squared**

## Why is Variance Squared

It makes outlines MORE important!


## When do we use Standard Deviation?

When we want to think in the same units as our data!

## Let's Practice on the board

Our dataset:

{7,7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 15, 20}

1) Find the Mean, Median, and Mode

2) Find the Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation

3) Let's Plot this data as a histogram, how would you describe it?

## Standardization

Sometimes we want to compare values that come from different distributions 

To compare apples with apples, we must standardize them

We can do this by **Transforming** each distribution such that both have a mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1

This is called a standard normal, or Z-distribution

## The Z-distribution of our Height Simulation

```{r zplot}
plot_histdens <- function(df) {
  hist <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Height)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Heights")

dens <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Height)) +
  geom_density(fill = 'blue', alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Density of Heights")

hist + dens
}

x_bar <- mean(df$Height)
s <- sd(df$Height)


sim10 <- data.frame(Height = rnorm(100000, mean = x_bar, sd = s) ) %>%
  rbind(df$Height)
  
sim_hist <- plot_histdens(sim10)

sim_z <- sim10 %>%
  mutate(Height = (Height - mean(Height)) / sd(Height))

sim_z <- plot_histdens(sim_z)

(sim_hist + ggtitle("Untransformed")) / (sim_z + ggtitle("Z Distribution"))

```

## What's the point?

By **Standardizing** Normal distributions we can compare them directly

For example if you want to know how students in a physics class did compared to student's in a french class on the respective midterm exams, you want to look at the Z-distributions!

## Standardizing also lets us compare individuals

Suppose you scored a 94 on your physics test and an 80 on your french test, on which test did you do better?

## Raw data

```{r zplot1}
test_dists <- data.frame(Physics = rnorm(29, mean = 95, sd = 1),
                         French = rnorm(29, mean = 70, sd = 3)) %>%
  rbind(data.frame(Physics = 94, French = 80)) %>%
  mutate(Physics.Z = (Physics-mean(Physics))/sd(Physics),
         French.Z = (French-mean(French))/sd(French))

test_dists %>%
  select(-Physics.Z, -French.Z) %>%
  gather("Test", "Raw Score") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Raw Score`, fill = Test)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~Test) +
  theme_minimal()

```


## Data Distributions

```{r zplot2}
test_dists <- data.frame(Physics = rnorm(29, mean = 95, sd = 1),
                         French = rnorm(29, mean = 70, sd = 3)) %>%
  rbind(data.frame(Physics = 94, French = 80)) %>%
  mutate(Physics.Z = (Physics-mean(Physics))/sd(Physics),
         French.Z = (French-mean(French))/sd(French))

test_dists %>%
  select(-Physics.Z, -French.Z) %>%
  gather("Test", "Raw Score") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Raw Score`)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = Test), adjust = 1.5) +  # Add density plots with different colors
  facet_wrap(~Test) +
  theme_minimal()

```


## Z-Distributions

```{r zplot3}
test_dists <- data.frame(Physics = rnorm(29, mean = 95, sd = 1),
                         French = rnorm(29, mean = 70, sd = 3)) %>%
  rbind(data.frame(Physics = 94, French = 80)) %>%
  mutate(Physics.Z = (Physics-mean(Physics))/sd(Physics),
         French.Z = (French-mean(French))/sd(French))

test_dists %>%
  select(-Physics, -French) %>%
  gather("Test", "Z Score") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Z Score`)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = Test), adjust = 1.5) +  # Add density plots with different colors
  facet_wrap(~Test) +
  theme_minimal()

```

`r test_dists[30,]`
