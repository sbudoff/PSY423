## Variablity

How spread out our data is

```{r plot1}
# Number of data points
n <- 1000

# Generate data for unimodal distribution
tight_data <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.5)

# Generate data for bimodal distribution
spread_data <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Generate data for trimodal distribution
very_data <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 2)

# Create data frame for plotting
df_var <- data.frame(
  Distribution = rep(c("SD = 0.5", "SD = 1.0", "SD = 2.0"), each = n),
  Values = c(tight_data, spread_data, very_data)
)

# Create a set of density plots using facet_wrap
ggplot(df_var, aes(x = Values, fill = Distribution)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Values", y = "Density", title = "Distributions With Different Variance") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "green", "purple")) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Distribution"))
```

## Measures of Variability

1) Range = Maximum - Minimum

2) Standard Deviation = How far apart numbers are (their difference from the mean) in a dataset

3) Variance = The average difference each value has from the mean **squared**

## Why is Variance Squared

It makes outlines MORE important!


## When do we use Standard Deviation?

When we want to think in the same units as our data!

## Let's Practice on the board

Our dataset:

{7,7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 15, 20}

1) Find the Mean, Median, and Mode

2) Find the Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation

3) Let's Plot this data as a histogram, how would you describe it?

## Standardization

Sometimes we want to compare values that come from different distributions 

To compare apples with apples, we must standardize them

We can do this by **Transforming** each distribution such that both have a mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1

This is called a standard normal, or Z-distribution

## The Z-distribution of our Height Simulation

```{r zplot}
plot_histdens <- function(df) {
  hist <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Height)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Heights")

dens <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Height)) +
  geom_density(fill = 'blue', alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Density of Heights")

hist + dens
}

x_bar <- mean(df$Height)
s <- sd(df$Height)


sim10 <- data.frame(Height = rnorm(100000, mean = x_bar, sd = s) ) %>%
  rbind(df$Height)
  
sim_hist <- plot_histdens(sim10)

sim_z <- sim10 %>%
  mutate(Height = (Height - mean(Height)) / sd(Height))

sim_z <- plot_histdens(sim_z)

(sim_hist + ggtitle("Untransformed")) / (sim_z + ggtitle("Z Distribution"))

```

## What's the point?

By **Standardizing** Normal distributions we can compare them directly

For example if you want to know how students in a physics class did compared to student's in a french class on the respective midterm exams, you want to look at the Z-distributions!

## Standardizing also lets us compare individuals

Suppose you scored a 94 on your physics test and an 80 on your french test, on which test did you do better?

## Raw data

```{r zplot1}
test_dists <- data.frame(Physics = rnorm(29, mean = 95, sd = 1),
                         French = rnorm(29, mean = 70, sd = 3)) %>%
  rbind(data.frame(Physics = 94, French = 80)) %>%
  mutate(Physics.Z = (Physics-mean(Physics))/sd(Physics),
         French.Z = (French-mean(French))/sd(French))

test_dists %>%
  select(-Physics.Z, -French.Z) %>%
  gather("Test", "Raw Score") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Raw Score`, fill = Test)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~Test) +
  theme_minimal()

```


## Data Distributions

```{r zplot2}
test_dists <- data.frame(Physics = rnorm(29, mean = 95, sd = 1),
                         French = rnorm(29, mean = 70, sd = 3)) %>%
  rbind(data.frame(Physics = 94, French = 80)) %>%
  mutate(Physics.Z = (Physics-mean(Physics))/sd(Physics),
         French.Z = (French-mean(French))/sd(French))

test_dists %>%
  select(-Physics.Z, -French.Z) %>%
  gather("Test", "Raw Score") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Raw Score`)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = Test), adjust = 1.5) +  # Add density plots with different colors
  facet_wrap(~Test) +
  theme_minimal()

```


## Z-Distributions

```{r zplot3}
test_dists <- data.frame(French = rnorm(29, mean = 70, sd = 3),
                         Physics = rnorm(29, mean = 95, sd = 1)
                         ) %>%
  rbind(data.frame(French = 80, Physics = 94)) %>%
  mutate(French.Z = (French-mean(French))/sd(French),
         Physics.Z = (Physics-mean(Physics))/sd(Physics))

test_dists %>%
  select(-Physics, -French) %>%
  gather("Test", "Z Score") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `Z Score`)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = Test), adjust = 1.5) +  # Add density plots with different colors
  facet_wrap(~Test) +
  theme_minimal()

print(test_dists[30,])
```

## Z-Score Calculation

You must first use your raw data to calculate your sample mean ($\bar{x}$), and sample standard deviation ($s$), then you can use these values to standardize your value of interest ($x$).

Then: $$z = \frac{x - \bar{x}{s} $$

If we are dealing with a full population, the logic is the same but the symbols we will use are now $\mu$ and $\sigma$ for the population mean and standard deviation respectively, so the formula looks like: $$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

## The Standard Normal let's you guestimate very easily!
![](/home/sam/Regis/PSY423/QR_Codes/normal_curve.png){width=750px}

## Practice Questions:
![](/home/sam/Regis/PSY423/QR_Codes/normal_curve.png){width=400px}

What percent of scores lie below z=1?

What percent lie above?

What percent of scores lie above and below the third standard deviation?

What percent of scores lie above and below the second standard deviation?

## Hypothesis Testing

Is there a reliable difference between a set of scores?

Think about some examples in your groups?

## Hypothesis Testing

A hypothesis is a guess, but in frequentist statistics we have a special way of framing it

Specifically we must remember we CAN NOT prove anything, we can only disprove something

Thus we must frame our hypothesis accordingly

With your examples try this for yourself

## Statistical Signifigance

This is our decision point where we decide if we reject our null hypothesis or not

Basically it asks if two values/distributions are "different enough"

Said differently, how confident are we in our decision?

## p-values

The formal name for what we compute is the p-value, it is the probability your samples came from the same distribution and **differences occurred by chance**

This is also the risk that you will make a **Type I Error**, that is you incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis

If you are hoping to reject a null hypothesis do you want this value to be high or low?

## Example

Suppose we have two vaccines that are being developed

Vaccine A protected 1000 volunteers, but failed to protect 3 (99.7% protected)

Vaccine B protected 4 volunteers, but failed to protect 1200 (0.33% protected)

What is your null hypothesis?

Roughly speaking do you expect the p-value that these vaccines are equally effective to be high or low

What can you conclude about the null hypothesis?

Which vaccine do you want?


## Example

Suppose we have two vaccines that are being developed

Vaccine A protected 700 volunteers, but failed to protect 224 (76% protected)

Vaccine B protected 800 volunteers, but failed to protect 296 (73% protected)

With more ambiguity, can you still guesstimate a p-value?

You still need to decide which vaccine you want...



## $\alpha = 0.05$

This is the typical threshold for a significant p-value

sigmas = c(seq(-5,-1), seq(1,5))
sigmas_df <- data.frame("sigma" = sigmas, "Prob" = cum_prob, "y" = c(0.5,0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5)) %>%

## Practice

What is a p-value in your own words?

Sally has an IQ = 140, which is a z-score of 2.67, is Sally statistically significantly different than the population?

True or False: All normal distributions are symmetrical

True or False: All normal distributions have a mean = 1

True or False: All normal distributions have a standard deviation = 1

True or False: All normal distributions have a total area (probability) under the curve = 1
