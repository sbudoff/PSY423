## Statistical Signifigance

This is our decision point where we decide if we reject our null hypothesis or not

Basically it asks if two values/distributions are "different enough"

Said differently, how confident are we in our decision?

## p-values

The probability your samples came from the same distribution and **differences occurred by chance**, AKA the risk that you will make a **Type I Error**, that is you incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis

```{r curve}

# Generate data points for the normal distribution
x <- seq(-10, 10, length.out = 1000)
y <- dnorm(x)

sigmas <- seq(-5,5)
cum_prob <- c()
for (i in 2:length(sigmas)) {
  cum_prob <- c(cum_prob, diff(pnorm(c(sigmas[i-1],sigmas[i]))))
}

sigmas = c(seq(-5,-1), seq(1,5))
sigmas_df <- data.frame("sigma" = sigmas, "Prob" = cum_prob, "y" = c(0.1, 0.2,0.3, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)) %>%
  mutate(Prob = sprintf("Ïƒ = %.0f => %.1e",sigmas, Prob))

## $\alpha = 0.05$

This is the typical threshold for a significant p-value

## $\alpha = 0.05$

![](p-value.png){width="700px"}

## Practice

What is a p-value in your own words?

Sally has an IQ = 140, which is a z-score of 2.67, is Sally statistically significantly different than the population?

True or False: All normal distributions are symmetrical

True or False: All normal distributions have a mean = 1

True or False: All normal distributions have a standard deviation = 1

True or False: All normal distributions have a total area (probability) under the curve = 1

## Calculating p-values

Simply the sum of the probability of what we observed, the probability of every other event that is as rare AND every event that is rarer

## Important Terminology

Practice saying these hypotheses in words $$H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2$$ $$H_a : \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$$ $p < \alpha$ : "Reject the null hypothesis"

$p >= \alpha$ : "Fail to reject the null hypothesis"

Type I error ($\alpha$) - The probability of rejecting a null hypothesis that should NOT be rejected, aka: a false positive

## Low p-values tell you if you are dealing with different distributions, but not how different, this is what Effect Size is for!

## Normal Distributions can differ from each other in several ways

In your groups try to image what these are

## Effect Size - Cohen's d

What fraction of the pooled variability observed is the difference between the means?

$$d = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2}{2}}}$$

## Have we seen something like this before?

## Cohen's d (or any effect size statistic) tells us how far apart the distributions are

```{r cohenstable}
library(knitr)

data.frame(`Effect Size` = c("Small", "Medium", "Large"),
            Convention = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8),
            Overlap = c(0.85, 0.67, 0.53)) %>%
  kable()
```

Try drawing roughly what these each look like for yourself

## Just Like $\alpha$ relates to important p-values, Power relates to important Effects

Power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually false

## Just Like $\alpha$ relates to important p-values, Power relates to important Effects

Power is the probability of making a correct decision when the null hypothesis is false

## Just Like $\alpha$ relates to important p-values, Power relates to important Effects

Power is the probability that a significance test will pick up on an effect that is present

## Just Like $\alpha$ relates to important p-values, Power relates to important Effects

Power is the probability of avoiding a **Type II Error**

## Type II Error is thus the complimentary idea of Type I error

![](errorTypes.jpg){width=700px}

## Quick Math Notation

In statistics Type I error is written as $\alpha$


In statistics Type II error is written as $\beta$

Power is the compliment of Type II error, since they are a probability how do you think we write Power in math symbols?

## Let's Practice

In groups make up an experiment, describe the hypothesis, then describe scenarios that associate with outcomes

## Confidence Intervals
