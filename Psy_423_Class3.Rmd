## Exploring our Data

## Histogram

```{r plot1}

plot_histdens <- function(df) {
  hist <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Height)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Heights")

dens <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Height)) +
  geom_density(fill = 'blue', alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Density of Heights")

hist + dens
}

plot_histdens(df)

```

## Let's Imagine we sampled 10 times more students

```{r plot2}

x_bar <- mean(df$Height)
s <- sd(df$Height)

sim10 <- data.frame(Height = rnorm(100, mean = x_bar, sd = s) ) %>%
  rbind(df$Height)
  

plot_histdens(sim10)

```


## Ok what about with 100 times more students (1000)

```{r plot3}
sim10 <- data.frame(Height = rnorm(1000, mean = x_bar, sd = s) ) %>%
  rbind(df$Height)
  
plot_histdens(sim10)

```

## 10000 samples?

```{r plot4}
sim10 <- data.frame(Height = rnorm(10000, mean = x_bar, sd = s) ) %>%
  rbind(df$Height)
  
plot_histdens(sim10)

```

## By 100000 samples we are converging on the Central Limit Theorem based on the laws of large numbers 

```{r plot5}
sim10 <- data.frame(Height = rnorm(100000, mean = x_bar, sd = s) ) %>%
  rbind(df$Height)
  
sim_hist <- plot_histdens(sim10)

sim_hist
```

## The Central Limit Theorem tell us this shape has a special name: The Normal Distribution

```{r plot6}
# Generate a sequence of x-values
x <- seq(-5, 5, by = 0.01)

# Calculate the normal PDF values for the x-values
pdf_values <- dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 2)

# Plot the normal PDF
plot(x, pdf_values, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "blue", 
     xlab = "x", ylab = "Probability", main = "Normal Probability Density Function")
```

## The Central Limit Theorem:

Given Random and Independent Samples of Observations, the **Sample Distribution**'s mean approaches normality as the size of the sample (denoted N) increases

This is true regardless of the shape of the **Population Distribution**


## Special features of a Normal Curve:
1) Bell Shaped
2) Symmetrical
3) Unimodal
4) With sufficiently large samples, we can **assume** most data will converge on a Normal

## Notice the last assumption, not all data is Normal

```{r plot7}
# Parameters for left-skewed beta distribution
alpha_left <- 5
beta_left <- 2

# Parameters for uniform distribution
alpha_c <- 1
beta_c <- 1

# Parameters for right-skewed beta distribution
alpha_right <- 2
beta_right <- 5

# Generate x-values for plotting
x_values <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.01)

# Calculate PDF values for left-skewed beta distribution
pdf_left <- dbeta(x_values, alpha_left, beta_left)

# Calculate PDF values for uniform beta distribution
pdf_c <- dbeta(x_values, alpha_c, beta_c)

# Calculate PDF values for right-skewed beta distribution
pdf_right <- dbeta(x_values, alpha_right, beta_right)

pdf_norm <- dnorm(x_values, 0.5, 0.2)

# Create data frame
data <- data.frame(
  Distribution = rep(c("Left Skewed", "Uniform", "Right Skewed", "Normal"), each = length(x_values)),
  x = rep(x_values, times = 4),
  PDF = c(pdf_left, pdf_c, pdf_right, pdf_norm)
)

# Create a side-by-side density plot using facet_wrap
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = PDF, group = Distribution, color = Distribution)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "x", y = "PDF", title = "Different Distributions") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue","green",  "red", "purple"))  +
  facet_wrap(~ Distribution, ncol = 2, scales = "free") 
```

## Focus on skewness

```{r plot8}
# Create a side-by-side density plot using facet_wrap
data %>%
  filter(Distribution %in% c("Left Skewed", "Right Skewed")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = PDF, group = Distribution, color = Distribution)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(x = "x", y = "PDF", title = "Different Distributions") +
    theme_minimal() +
    facet_wrap(~ Distribution, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("blue",  "red")) 
```

## Let's Predict The skew
1) Number of children per household
2) Income in the US
3) SAT/ACT Scores

## Let's Predict The Distribution
1) Height of trees in the forest
2) Dice rolls with a fair dice
3) Length of comments on a youtube video

## Measures of Central Tendency
1) Mean
2) Median
3) Mode

## Visualizing Measures of Central Tendency

```{r plot9}
# Calculate mean and mode
mean_value <- mean(df$Height)
median_value <- median(df$Height)

getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

mode_value <- getmode(df$Height)

# Create the plot with mean and mode lines
box <- ggplot(df, aes(y = Height)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = median_value, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_value, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mode_value, color = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(y = "Height", title = "Boxplot with Mean and Mode") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
hist <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Height)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_value, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mode_value, color = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Heights")
hist + box
```

## Modality

"The" mode can be a set of values!

```{r plot10}
# Number of data points
n <- 1000

# Generate data for unimodal distribution
unimodal_data <- rnorm(n+1, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Generate data for bimodal distribution
bimodal_data <- c(rnorm(n / 2, mean = -2, sd = 0.5), rnorm(n / 2, mean = 2, sd = 0.5))

# Generate data for trimodal distribution
trimodal_data <- c(rnorm(n / 3, mean = -3, sd = 0.5),
                   rnorm(n / 3, mean = 0, sd = 0.5),
                   rnorm(n / 3, mean = 3, sd = 0.5))

# Create data frame for plotting
df <- data.frame(
  Distribution = rep(c("1 Peak = Unimodal", "2 Peaks =Bimodal", "3+ Peaks = Trimodal or Multimodal"), each = n),
  Values = c(unimodal_data, bimodal_data, trimodal_data)
)

# Create a set of density plots using facet_wrap
ggplot(df, aes(x = Values, fill = Distribution)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Values", y = "Density", title = "Distributions: Unimodal, Bimodal, Trimodal") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = 'None') +
  facet_wrap(~ Distribution, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "green", "purple")) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Distribution"))
```


## Think on it


1. In a normally distributed dataset, which is the greatest (highest) value: mean, median, or mode?
2. Do all data have a mean, median, and mode?

3. For any dataset, which measures of central tendency must have only 1 value?

4. When is the mode the best measure of central tendency?

5. What if you need to report the mode, but no number in your distribution occurs twice (e.g., all
numbers are reported to 2 decimals).


## Variablity

How spread out our data is

```{r plot11}
# Number of data points
n <- 1000

# Generate data for unimodal distribution
tight_data <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.5)

# Generate data for bimodal distribution
spread_data <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Generate data for trimodal distribution
very_data <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 2)

# Create data frame for plotting
df <- data.frame(
  Distribution = rep(c("SD = 0.5", "SD = 1.0", "SD = 2.0"), each = n),
  Values = c(tight_data, spread_data, very_data)
)

# Create a set of density plots using facet_wrap
ggplot(df, aes(x = Values, fill = Distribution)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Values", y = "Density", title = "Distributions With Different Variance") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "green", "purple")) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Distribution"))
```

## Measures of Variability

1) Range = Maximum - Minimum

2) Standard Deviation = How far apart numbers are (their difference from the mean) in a dataset

3) Variance = The average difference each value has from the mean **squared**

## Why is Variance Squared

It makes outlines MORE important!


## When do we use Standard Deviation?

When we want to think in the same units as our data!

## Let's Practice on the board

Our dataset:

{7,7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 15, 20}

1) Find the Mean, Median, and Mode

2) Find the Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation

3) Let's Plot this data as a histogram, how would you describe it?

## Standardization

Sometimes we want to compare values that come from different distributions 

To compare apples with apples, we must standardize them

We can do this by **Transforming** each distribution such that both have a mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1

This is called a standard normal, or Z-distribution

## The Z-distribution of our Height Simulation

```{r zplot}

sim_z <- sim10 %>%
  mutate(Height = (Height - mean(Height)) / sd(Height))

sim_z <- plot_histdens(sim_z)

(sim_hist + ggtitle("Untransformed")) / (sim_z + ggtitle("Z Distribution"))

```
